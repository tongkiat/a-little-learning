# A Little Learning

> A little learning is a dangerous thing ;  
> Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring :  
> There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,  
> And drinking largely sobers us again.  
> Fired at first sight with what the Muse imparts,  
> In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts ;  
> While from the bounded level of our mind  
> Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind,  
> But, more advanced, behold with strange surprise  
> New distant scenes of endless science rise !  
> So pleased at first the towering Alps we try,  
> Mount o’er the vales, and seem to tread the sky ;  
> The eternal snows appear already past,  
> And the first clouds and mountains seem the last ;  
> But those attained, we tremble to survey  
> The growing labours of the lengthened way ;  
> The increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes,  
> Hills peep o’er hills, and Alps on Alps arise !
>
